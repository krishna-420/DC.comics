<h3>Some of my favourite DC comics characters</h3>
<h2>JOKER</h2>
<div class="rachael">
<a href="joker.HeathLeadger.jpg"> <img class="gordon" src="joker.HeathLeadger.jpg"></a>
<p>The Joker has undergone many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common interpretation of the character is that he is disguised as the criminal Red Hood and pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals that bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane.Jack Napier
    Batman: The Animated Series would name him Jack Napier in one episode, and the aforementioned comic series Batman: White Knight revealed the Joker's real name was Jack NapierJokers's IQ is estimated to be around 350 (which is insane even in the real world), while Batman's is around 290In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor; the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s.</p>

    Batman is also known as the 'Caped Crusader', the 'World's Greatest Detective', and the 'Dark Knight'. While most superheroes have superpowers, Batman does not. He relies on his martial arts skills, detective skills, physical strength, intellect, wealth, technology, and will to face the criminals in Gotham City.What are Batman's Super Powers? Batman doesn't have any superhuman powers, but relies on high tech gear, martial arts, and high intelligence. His special gear for fighting crime is often stored in his utility belt.Batman's no-kill rule is the foundation of his character, but has put him in great perils. Batman's greatest weaknesses such as his humanity, vulnerability, and moralities - while weakening him - are also his greatest strengths.

<p>Catwoman, cartoon character, a wily and agile professional thief and sometime love interest of superhero Batman.

<h2>HARLEY QUINN</h2>
<div class="rachael" id="Harley-quinn">
<img class="margotrobbie" src="HarleyQuinn.MargotRobbie.jpg">
<p>Harley Quinn was created by writer Paul Dini and artist Bruce Timm for the Batman: The Animated Series episode entitled "Joker's Favor" in 1992. Initially written as an animated equivalent of a walk-on role, Harley was intended to appear in just one episode.Though at first she seems sweet, giddy, and girlish, that's just one side of Harley's personality. She's also vicious, violent, and a fierce fighter. There's little rhyme or reason to Harley's moods, which makes her impossible to predict. But above all, Harley strives to enjoy life.Harley has no real superpowers, but was injected with a special toxin antidote by Poison Ivy, which resulted in her becoming immune to various forms of chemicals, such as Ivy's pheromones and Joker Venom. The injection also gave Harley enhanced strength and durability, making her a formidable hand-to-hand combatant.Most fans would likely agree that it wasn't that long ago that Harley's biggest weakness had one name — Joker. In both the animated series that marked Harley's conception and in the comics, Harley couldn't resist the Joker.</p>

<h2>WONDER WOMAN</h2>
<div class="rachael" id="Wonder-Woman">
<img class="galgadot" src="WonderWoman.GalGadot.jpg">
<p>Wonder Woman is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of the Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star Comics #8 in October 1941 with her first feature in Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942.In addition to her natural superpowers she has some great gear, too: Indestructible bracelets - used to block bullets or other weapons. Lasso-of-truth - used to force someone lassoed by it to tell the truth. Invisible plane - although Wonder Woman can fly without her plane she uses her plane to fly into outer space.She was not born from a lump of clay (go figure!), but rather the result of an affair between Hippolyta and Zeus. In other words, she's not merely a gifted Amazon, she's a full-fledged demigod. And rather than “channeling” the gifts of Zeus through her bracelets, etc., Diana is the source of her own power</p>
